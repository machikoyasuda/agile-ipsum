    "Do an agile kanban iterating minimum viable product. Hipchat it to me. Fantastic. Are you on Trello? Get on Basecamp with General Assembly. Don't even think about Sublime Text 3, bash, Unix, Mac OS X, Linux. What about TDD, BDD, NoSQL, MySQL, Postgres? You don't even know my git. I have MongoDB, MongoID, MongoMapper, Mongodump. Did you Rspec with Cucumber already? What about Capybara and Capistrano and all those other things? Git init. I like my CSS with some Sass. But Less is better. You don't even have the latest stable version of Ruby, do you? RVM or RBENV? Did you rbenv rehash? Don't even think about not using Heroku."
